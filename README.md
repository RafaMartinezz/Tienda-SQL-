# SQL Database Practice Project

This project is a **practice SQL database** designed for learning and mastering database modification and management. The project focuses on enhancing an existing database structure with added constraints, new columns, and user permissions, making it an ideal tool for practicing SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) operations.

## Project Overview

The SQL Database Practice Project provides an existing database schema that learners will modify through various DDL operations. The goal of this project is to practice creating and altering tables, setting constraints, modifying user permissions, and managing database objects with SQL.

> **Note**: This project is purely educational and does not represent a full-fledged application.

## Project Structure

This project includes SQL scripts for:

- Adding new columns and constraints to tables
- Dropping and renaming tables
- Creating and modifying user permissions
- Practicing constraints and data integrity in SQL

## Learning Goals

This project helps develop the following skills:

- Understanding and applying SQL DDL commands (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `RENAME`)
- Creating primary and foreign key constraints to manage data relationships
- Defining and enforcing data integrity constraints
- Managing user roles and permissions in SQL databases
- Renaming and dropping database tables and constraints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you’ll need:

- An SQL database environment (e.g., Oracle SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- A tool for running SQL scripts, such as SQL*Plus, MySQL Workbench, or pgAdmin.

## Tasks and Operations

The project includes the following main tasks:

1. **Table Modifications**:
   - Add columns and set default values.
   - Add constraints to limit the values in certain columns.

2. **Constraint Management**:
   - Set constraints on columns to ensure data integrity, including primary keys, unique constraints, and value restrictions.

3. **User and Permissions Management**:
   - Create a new database user and assign permissions.
   - Revoke certain permissions to control access to sensitive data.

4. **Table Renaming and Deletion**:
   - Rename tables and drop tables as part of database maintenance.
